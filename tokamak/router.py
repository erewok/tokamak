class AsgiRouter:
    """
    A AsgiRouter for a Tokamak Application is one or more `Route`s
    with an optional configuration for matching trailing slashes or not.

    Example:
        We can define an endpoint handler to associate with any route:

            async def some_handler(scope, receive, send):
                message = await receive()
                body = message.get("body") or b"{}"
                payload = json.dumps({"received": json.loads(body)}).encode("utf-8")
                return Response(body=payload)

        After that, we can include associate the handler with an endpoint:

            AsgiRouter(routes=[
                Route("/", handler=some_handler, methods=["GET"]),
                Route("/files/{dir}/{filepath:*}", handler=some_handler, methods=["POST"]),

            ])

    A dynamic route takes a name for the captured variable and a regex matcher,
    like so: `"/regex/{name:[a-zA-Z]+}/test"`

    The values matched in paths are always returned in the `context` as strings.
